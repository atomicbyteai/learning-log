📅 Date: 15 February 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 1 hour  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- @staticmethod
- @classmethod

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts )
- Static methods do not access instance or class variables directly.
- Class methods use `cls` and can modify class-level data.
- They help organize logic inside a class properly.

---

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Creating static methods inside a class
- Writing class methods that modify class variables
- Comparing instance methods vs class methods vs static methods

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Build a mini OOP project using:
  - Magic methods
  - property

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
OOP concepts are becoming clearer as I connect different pieces together.
