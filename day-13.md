# Day 13 – super() & Method Overriding in Python

📅 Date: 9 February 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 1 hours  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- `super()` keyword
- Method overriding

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts 
- `super()` is used to call methods from a parent class
- Method overriding allows a child class to provide its own implementation of a method

---

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Overriding parent class methods in child classes
- Using `super()` to reuse parent class logic

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Practice inheritance with more examples
- Build a small OOP-based program

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
OOP concepts are starting to make more sense now. Learning inheritance step by step really helps.
