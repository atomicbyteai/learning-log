# Day 2 – Python Strings & Conditional Expressions

📅 Date: 27 January 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 1 hour  
💼 Note: Had in-house internship today

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- Conditional expressions (ternary operator)
- String indexing
- Common string methods (`upper`, `lower`, `strip`, `replace`, `find`, `len`)

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts 
- Conditional expressions allow writing simple `if-else` logic in one line
- Strings are sequences, so they can be indexed
- String methods help manipulate and analyze text easily

---

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Accessing characters using string indexing
- Used different string methods on user input
- Wrote small examples to understand conditional expressions like finding even odd , positive negative number etc

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Revise strings
- Learn loops (`for`, `while`)

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
Even with internship work, I managed to stay consistent. Progress may be slow, but consistency matters more.
