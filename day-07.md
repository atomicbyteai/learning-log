# Day 7 – Iterables & List Comprehension in Python

📅 Date: 1 February 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 1–2 hours  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- Iterables in Python
- Membership operators (`in`, `not in`)
- List comprehension

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Iterables are objects that can be looped over, like lists and strings
- Membership operators help check if an element exists in a collection
- List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists using loops and conditions

---

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Iterated over different data types
- Used membership operators to check data
- Converted traditional loops into list comprehensions

---

## ❗ Challenges Faced
- Understanding list comprehension syntax initially

---

## ✅ How I Solved Them
- Practiced small examples to understand the flow

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Practice more list comprehension problems
- Revise previous concepts
- Match-case statements 
---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
List comprehension felt confusing at first, but practicing small examples helped make it clearer and more readable.
