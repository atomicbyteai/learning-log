# Day 1 – Python Basics

📅 Date: 26 January 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 3 hours  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- Variables in Python
- Type casting (`int`, `float`, `str`)
- Taking user input
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Variables store data values that can change
- Type casting is used to convert one data type into another
- `if-else` helps in decision making based on conditions
- Logical operators help combine multiple conditions

---

## 💻 What I Built / Practiced
- Built a **simple calculator** using Python
- Used user input and conditional logic

---

## 🔗 Code / Resources
- GitHub Repo: `python-dsa/python-basics/calculator.py`

---

## ❗ Challenges Faced
- No challenges faced because I have prior knowledge of C and C++

---

## 🔁 What I’ll Improve Tomorrow
- Learn loops (`for`, `while`)
- Improve calculator using a loop

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
Today was productive. Building a small project helped me understand concepts better than just watching tutorials.
