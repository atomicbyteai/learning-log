# Day 3 – Loops & Formatting in Python

📅 Date: 28 January 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 2 hours  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- Format specifiers in Python
- `for` loop
- `while` loop

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Format specifiers help control how values are displayed in output
- `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known
- `while` loop runs as long as long as the condition is true

---

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Printed formatted output using format specifiers
- Wrote basic `for` loop programs and nested loop programs 
- Used `while` loop for repeated execution based on conditions

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Practice loops more
- lists, sets, and tuples

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
Learning loops feels like an important step forward. More practice will help make them feel natural.
