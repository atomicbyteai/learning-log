# Day 4 – Collections & Dictionaries in Python

📅 Date: 29 January 2026  
⏱️ Time Spent: 2 hours  

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- Collections in Python (lists , sets , tuple)
- 2D collections
- Dictionaries

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Collections allows to storing multiple values in a single variable
- 2D collections store data in rows and columns
- Dictionaries store data in key–value pairs
- Dictionaries are useful for mapping items to values like prices

---

## 💻 What I Built / Practiced
- Implemented collections and dictionaries by building a **concession stand program**
- Used dictionaries to store items and prices
- Practiced accessing and updating values from collections

---

## ❗ Challenges Faced
- Understanding how to organize data in 2D collections
- Choosing between lists and dictionaries

---

## ✅ How I Solved Them
- Broke the problem into smaller parts
- Printed values to understand the structure
- Tested small examples

---

## 🔁 Plan for Tomorrow
- Revise collections
- Practice more dictionary-based programs
- Learn functions in Python

---

## ⭐ Daily Reflection
Building a small real-world program helped me understand collections and dictionaries better than just theory.
